# convert_images_to_webP_desktop_app

Create a folder called "images_to_convert" and dump all the png, jpg photos to convert, "DO_NOT_TOUCH" has background images which needs to be resized, to make match the size
of the tkinter app. They update everytime the app is run. I added this feature to create a joke to my coworkers, you can just delete that part if you want.
